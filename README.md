# High-dimensional latent structure in visual cortex representations

Hey!

If you're here, you probably scanned the QR code on my poster at VSS (Vision Sciences Society) 2023. This repository contains my poster (linked below) if you want to take a closer look at it. If you have any comments, suggestions, questions or general feedback, please contact me (Raj) at rgautha1@jh.edu!

Thanks for your interest! :D
